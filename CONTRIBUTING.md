## Contrubuting
Please be respectful to other people even if their beliefs or opinions differ from yours. <br/>
Before opening an issue, please be sure there is not another issue open about the exact same thing. If there is, you can add your opinion or fix to that issue's comments. <br/>
If your issue was closed as `invalid`, please avoid immediately opening another issue without correcting the problem. Doing so will result in that issue being closed as well. <br/>
Please understand that I am only one person, and that I will not be able to respond to or correct your issue immediately. If something is important, please @ reference me in that issue and I will check it out.<br/>
Please follow the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines#what-is-not-allowed) or else you will be banned from this Repo and reported to GitHub. <br/>

I will currently not be accepting issues for server-side paywalls (unless you have a fix) as there is **nothing** I can do about them. I will also not be accepting issues for unbreaking sites blocked as malware. If you report cookie-banners/breakage/paywalls on these sites, your issue will be closed with a recommendation that you scan your device for malware. I _will_ accept issues for removing false positives.
