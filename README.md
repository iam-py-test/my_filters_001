# My filters
This is a repo where I upload my filters. <br/>
Feel free to use any and all of them (they are under no copyright) in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (recommended) or AdBGuard. <br/>
Please report any issues you have and I will try to fix them; please note I may not reply within the day the issue is posted as I am often busy.


### Filters
This repo contains the following lists:
- Pornography Blocklist (porn.txt)
- Malware domains and URLs list (antimalware.txt)
- Anti Cookie-consent and paywalls list (anti-cookie+sign up.txt)
- Anti redirectors list (anti-redirectors.txt)
- Anti typosquatting list (antitypo.txt)
- Anti url tracking list (privacy.txt)

These lists are designed for uBlock Origin and may work in AdGuard. They are untested in AdBlock Plus.<br/>
If you need these lists in alternet formats, you can use the following. Note that the _Anti cookie-conset and paywalls list_ will not and can not be transfered into another format.
